# Personal Website - Gerard Otalora

In this project I will work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery in order
to create a personal website that I can use to display my personal
and professional projects. The idea is to create a stylish yet minimalist
black and white website.

## Heroku Link

## Website Structure

My personal website consists of four pages:
- **Home:** the _index.html_ page displays basic information about myself such
as my name, a few keywords that represent me, a picture and the LinkedIn and
Twitter icons that are _external links_ and will bring the user to my profile
page of these social media platforms. I have added a little bit of extra
_CSS style_ to these icons so when the mouse is on them their opacity decreases.
- **About:** the _about.htlm_ page displays another picture of me and a short
background and description of my career goals, interests and hobbies.
- **Work experience:**
- **Contact:**

**Note:** all four pages share a _header bar_ with _internal links_ to all four
pages so it is easy for the user to mover through the website without the need
to use the back/forward arrows.

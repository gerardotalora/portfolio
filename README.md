# Personal Website - Gerard Otalora

In this project I will work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery in order
to create a personal/CV-style website that I can use to display my personal
and professional projects.

## Website Structure

My personal website consists of four main pages:
- **Home:** friendly introduction to the new visitor of my website.
- **About:** a professional picture of me and a short description of
my career goals, interests and hobbies.
- **Work experience:** a resume in a table format.
- **Contact:** info on how to reach out to me.

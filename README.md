# Personal Website - Gerard Otalora

In this project I will work with HTML, CSS, Javascript and JQuery in order
to create a personal website that I can use to display my personal
and professional projects. The idea is to create a stylish yet minimalist
black and white website.

## Website Structure

My personal website consists of three pages:
- **Home:** the _index.html_ page displays basic information about myself such
as my name, a few keywords that represent me, a picture and the LinkedIn and
Twitter icons that are _external links_ and will bring the user to my profile
page of these social media platforms. I have added a little bit of extra
_CSS style_ to these icons so when the mouse is on them their opacity decreases.
- **About:** the _about.htlml_ page displays another picture of me, a short
background and three collapsibles with my education, experience and fun facts.
- **Contact:** the _contact.html_ page displays a message _Let's talk!_, some
personal contact information as well as icons with my social media accounts
(same as in home page).

**Note:** all three pages share a _header bar_ with _internal links_ to all four
pages so it is easy for the user to mover through the website without the need
to use the back/forward arrows.
